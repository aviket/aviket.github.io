    <h2>About Us </h2>
			<p>The Vermont Midrange User Group (VTMUG) was formed in April 1992 and provides IBM i educational information and related presentations at an incredibly low price.</p>
			<p>VTMUG is also affiliated with NEUGC which runs a 2 1/2 day conference each spring in Framingham Mass. The conference is similar in nature to the Common conference and is very highly rated by the speakers and attendees. </p>
			<p>We are an independent organization (supported, but not sponsored, by IBM). We have by-laws, a bank account, and officers (volunteers from among the membership). We meet regularly to discuss topics related to the IBM i. Some are technical, some are management related. IBM presents new product information as soon as it is available. Presenters may be from IBM, other vendors, consultants, or members of the group. </p>
			<p>Anyone interested in the IBM i may attend the meetings. You do not have to own an IBM i to become a member; users of other systems, consultants, etc., are all welcome. (Our mailing list is not distributed.) </p>
			<p>We have a summer meeting held in West Lebanon, NH and a fall technical conference held in the Burlington area. </p>
			<p>Joining VTMUG is FREE. Costs for individual events are determined annually but it is minimal. </p>
			<p>Questions may be directed to the group's president: <script>sendTo("Brian Garland", "o", "vtmug", "President")</script></p>
